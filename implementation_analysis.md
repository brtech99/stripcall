# StripCall Implementation Analysis

## Documentation vs Implementation Discrepancies

### Problem Resolution
- Documentation states problems remain visible for "a few minutes" after resolution
- Code doesn't show any implementation of this timing mechanism
- Need to implement auto-removal of resolved problems

### Crew Chief Management
- Documentation states crew chiefs can't lead multiple crews in same tournament
- Code doesn't enforce this restriction in `crew_dialog.dart`
- Need to add validation in crew creation/editing

### SMS Integration
- Documentation describes SMS functionality
- No SMS-related code found in the codebase
- Need to implement Twilio integration

## Missing Features

### Problem Management
- `problems_page.dart` is just a placeholder ("Coming Soon")
- Missing implementation of:
  * Problem reporting
  * Problem resolution
  * Message system
  * "On our way" quick message

### Crew Management
- `manage_crews_page.dart` is incomplete ("Under Construction")
- Missing implementation of:
  * Crew member management
  * Crew chief assignment
  * Crew type management

### Tournament Features
- Missing implementation of:
  * Pod-based strip numbering
  * Finals strip handling
  * Tournament date validation

## Database Schema Issues

### Missing Tables
- No `symptomclass` table (mentioned in docs)
- No `symptom` table (mentioned in docs)
- No `oldProblemClass` table (mentioned in docs)
- No `problems` table (mentioned in docs)

### Schema Mismatches
- `crewtypes` table exists but named differently in code (`crew_types`)
- `symptom_classes` table exists but not mentioned in schema

## To-Do List

### 1. Problem Management

## Notes
- This analysis was created on [current date]
- Based on comparison between StripCallAppRules.md and current codebase
- Will need to be updated as implementation progresses
