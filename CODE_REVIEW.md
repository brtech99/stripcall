# StripCall Code Review

## Executive Summary

This code review provides a comprehensive analysis of the StripCall project, covering the Flutter frontend, the Supabase backend functions, and the PostgreSQL database schema. The project is functional but suffers from significant technical debt, architectural inconsistencies, and several critical security vulnerabilities.

The application's own rules, as defined in `StripCallAppRules.md`, are frequently violated. While some cleanup has occurred (as noted in `PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md`), many of the core issues identified in that document persist, and new ones have been discovered.

The most critical issues are:
1.  **An unprotected backend function** that allows anyone to send push notifications to any user.
2.  **A lack of defined Row-Level Security (RLS) policies** on core database tables, creating a major data security risk.
3.  **Missing indexes on the database**, which will lead to severe performance degradation over time.

Addressing these issues, particularly the security vulnerabilities, should be the highest priority. The following sections detail all findings and provide a prioritized list of recommendations.

---

## A. Critical Security Vulnerabilities

These issues represent a direct and immediate risk to the application's security and data integrity. They should be addressed before any new features are developed.

### 1. Unprotected Notification Function
- **File:** `supabase/functions/send-fcm-notification/index.ts`
- **Issue:** The `send-fcm-notification` Edge Function has **no authentication or authorization checks**. Any user on the internet who discovers the function URL can call it.
- **Impact:** This allows a malicious actor to send arbitrary push notifications to any user in the system by guessing or obtaining their user IDs. This could be used for phishing attacks, spreading misinformation, or harassing users. This is a **critical vulnerability**.
- **Recommendation:** Add authentication to the function immediately. The function should verify that the request comes from an authenticated user. Furthermore, it should check if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions (e.g., is a Crew Chief or Organizer) to send the requested notification.

### 2. Insecure `auth_users_view`
- **File:** `supabase/migrations/20240320000009_create_auth_users_view.sql`
- **Issue:** This view exposes the entire `auth.users` table, including sensitive fields like `encrypted_password`, `confirmation_sent_at`, and other metadata.
- **Impact:** While the password is a hash, exposing it is an unnecessary risk and violates the principle of least privilege. An attacker with authenticated access could potentially use this information to analyze password hashes for weaknesses.
- **Recommendation:** Modify the view to expose only the fields that are absolutely necessary for the client application, such as `id`, `email`, and `last_sign_in_at`.

### 3. Insecure CORS Policy
- **Files:** All files in `supabase/functions/`
- **Issue:** All backend functions are configured with `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'`.
- **Impact:** This allows any website on the internet to make requests to the Supabase functions, which is overly permissive. While the functions have their own auth checks (except for the notification function), this is still a security risk and is not a best practice.
- **Recommendation:** Restrict the CORS policy to the specific domain(s) where the Flutter web app is hosted.

## B. Architecture & Design Issues

These are high-level problems related to the fundamental structure and design of the application.

### 1. Widespread Use of `setState` for State Management
- **Files:** Most files in `lib/pages/` and `lib/widgets/` (200+ occurrences).
- **Issue:** The application relies heavily on `setState()` for state management. This violates the rule in `StripCallAppRules.md` to use a dedicated state management library. While `GetX` was removed, no replacement was properly implemented.
- **Impact:** Over-reliance on `setState` in large widget trees leads to inefficient re-builds, poor performance, and code that is difficult to maintain and test. Business logic becomes tightly coupled with UI code.
- **Recommendation:** Adopt a modern state management solution like **Riverpod** or **Provider**. Refactor the pages, starting with the most complex ones like `problems_page.dart`, to move business logic and state out of the widgets and into dedicated controllers or providers.

### 2. Exclusive Use of Material Design Widgets
- **Files:** Most UI files in `lib/pages/` and `lib/widgets/`.
- **Issue:** The application uses Material Design components (e.g., `Scaffold`, `AppBar`) exclusively, violating the rule to use `flutter_platform_widgets` for a platform-adaptive UI.
- **Impact:** The app provides a poor user experience on iOS devices, as it will look and feel like an Android app. This creates a jarring and unprofessional experience for iOS users.
- **Recommendation:** Re-introduce the `flutter_platform_widgets` dependency and refactor the UI to use platform-adaptive widgets (`PlatformScaffold`, `PlatformAppBar`, `PlatformTextButton`, etc.).

### 3. Incomplete Refactoring of Large Files
- **File:** `lib/pages/problems/problems_page.dart`
- **Issue:** While some refactoring has occurred (extracting `ProblemCard` and `ProblemService`), `problems_page.dart` is still a 600+ line "fat widget". It manages numerous state variables, timers, data fetch operations, and complex UI logic all in one place.
- **Impact:** This file is difficult to understand, modify, and test. It violates the single responsibility principle.
- **Recommendation:** Continue the refactoring effort. Use a state management solution (see B.1) to move the state and business logic out of the widget. The widget should be responsible only for displaying the UI based on the current state.

## C. Database Issues

The database schema has a solid foundation but is missing critical components for security and performance.

### 1. Missing RLS Policies for Core Tables
- **File:** `supabase/migrations/20240300000000_create_base_tables.sql`
- **Issue:** Row-Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all the core tables (`users`, `events`, `crews`, `problem`, etc.), but **no policies are defined for them**.
- **Impact:** This is a **major security gap**. It implies one of two things: either the client is using the god-mode `service_role_key` to access data (a critical vulnerability if the key is exposed on the client), or RLS is not being enforced correctly. Well-defined RLS policies are the cornerstone of Supabase security.
- **Recommendation:** Define and implement RLS policies for all core tables. These policies should enforce the business rules described in `StripCallAppRules.md` (e.g., organizers can only edit their own events, crew members can only see problems for their crews, etc.).

### 2. Missing Indexes on Foreign Keys
- **Files:** `supabase/migrations/20240300000000_create_base_tables.sql`
- **Issue:** The core tables are missing database indexes on their foreign key columns (e.g., `problem.event`, `crews.event`, `crewmembers.crew`).
- **Impact:** This will cause severe query performance degradation as the database grows. Lookups that filter by these columns will require slow, full-table scans.
- **Recommendation:** Create a new migration to add indexes to all frequently queried foreign key columns. The `crew_messages` migration can be used as a template for how to do this correctly.

### 3. Lack of Cascade Deletes
- **File:** `supabase/migrations/20240300000000_create_base_tables.sql`
- **Issue:** The foreign key constraints do not use `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- **Impact:** This forces the application logic (e.g., the `delete-user` function) to manually clean up all related data. This is error-prone and can easily lead to orphaned records in the database.
- **Recommendation:** Add `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL` to foreign key constraints where appropriate. For example, when an `event` is deleted, all of its `crews`, `problems`, and `crewmembers` should probably be deleted as well.

---

## D. Code Quality & Refactoring Opportunities

### 1. Pervasive Generic Exception Handling
- **Files:** Throughout the codebase (`catch (e)` has over 150 matches).
- **Issue:** The code consistently uses generic `catch (e)` blocks instead of catching specific exception types.
- **Impact:** This makes the code harder to debug and can lead to incorrect behavior, as different types of errors are not handled distinctly. It can also swallow important stack traces.
- **Recommendation:** Refactor error handling to catch specific exception types (e.g., `AuthException`, `PostgrestException`) where possible. Use the `debugLogError` utility to log the full error and stack trace.

### 2. Inconsistent and Excessive Logging
- **Files:** Throughout the codebase (`print(` has over 100 matches).
- **Issue:** Despite the existence of `lib/utils/debug_utils.dart`, the code is littered with unconditional `print()` statements.
- **Impact:** This makes debugging difficult due to console spam and can leak internal application data in production logs. The `kDebugLogging` flag is not being respected.
- **Recommendation:** Create a lint rule to ban `print` and `debugPrint`. Replace all existing `print()` calls with `debugLog()` or `debugLogError()` from the utility file.

### 3. Backend Code Clutter
- **Files:** `supabase/functions/`
- **Issue:** The functions directory is messy. It contains a dead function (`send-notification`), confusingly named functions (`get-auth-users-working`), and redundant logic.
- **Recommendation:**
    - Delete the `send-notification` function.
    - Delete the `get-users-data-working` function, as `get-auth-users-working` is a better implementation.
    - Rename `get-auth-users-working` to `get_all_users` or something more descriptive.
    - Clean up the excessive `console.log` statements in all functions, replacing them with a more structured logger if possible.

## E. Incomplete Features & Configuration

### 1. Critical Android Configuration Missing
- **File:** `android/app/build.gradle`
- **Issue:** The file contains `TODO` comments indicating that the unique `applicationId` and the release `signingConfig` have not been set up.
- **Impact:** The application cannot be built for a production release on the Google Play Store without these configurations.
- **Recommendation:** Configure a unique application ID and set up a secure signing configuration for release builds.

### 2. Lingering TODOs
- **Files:** `lib/services/notification_service.dart`, `lib/widgets/settings_menu.dart`
- **Issue:** There are `TODO` comments for implementing navigation from push notifications and for the "Account" page in the settings menu.
- **Impact:** These represent an incomplete user experience.
- **Recommendation:** Prioritize and implement these missing features.
